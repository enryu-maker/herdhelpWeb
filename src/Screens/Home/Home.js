                My friend and I are both Christians and farmers in South
                Alabama. We both grew up here and both grew up raising cows. He
                still has cows and I mainly raise goats now. My background is
                computer software and technology and recently he has been taking
                programming classes. So you can tell how the two of us creating
                an APP to manage your livestock happened. We both understand
                technology and both understand animal husbandry. I decided to
                grow my goat herd to a larger scale and I needed the tools to do
                that in an organized manner. So here we are. As business people,
                we know what we need to see a profit. With goats and sheep itâ€™s
                kidding rates and with cows its weight gains. And with any
                animal that we raise we need healthy animals. If you track all
                your data you will have the tools to tell you which animals to
                cull and which animals are out producing the others. We hope
                that it helps you as much as it helps our farms.

                    need to see a profit. With goats and sheep itâ€™s kidding
                    rates and with cows its weight gains. And with any animal
                    that we raise we need healthy animals. If you track all your
                    data you will have the tools to tell you which animals to
                    cull and which animals are out producing the others. We hope
                    that it helps you as much as it helps our farms.
